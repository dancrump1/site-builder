# Drive Brand Studio CraftCMS V4 template
### Last reviewed 2/16/2024

## Repository Structure
   `/.ddev/` — We utilize DDEV to handle self-hosting of the dev environment. </br>
   `/config/` — CraftCMS config. This should be mostly left alone.    </br>
   `/src/` — Un-minified JS and CSS files </br>
   `/templates/` — Source code for our front-end, written in Twig. </br>
   `/web/` — the folder containing the generated minified documents for the website, as well as local assets (images, videos, etc) that are stored on the webserver (preferably, store them somewhere where storage is cheaper and make a network request to fetch I.E. put a video on youtube instead of in here)

## Style Guide
   - DBS Twig template folder structuring is inspired by the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
   - Prettier works (most of the time), so format on save
   - We have no linter yet 😬
   - Follow 'prior art' by referencing existing code within the codebase   


## Requirements
1. NodeJS version 14+
2. Ubuntu
3. PHP 8.1+
4. DDEV
5. Docker

## Steps 
1. Clone the scaffolding code **OR** use the scaffold to start a templated github repo:

   <details>
      <summary>Creating folder on local computer</summary>
      <p>
      SSH (preferred):
      
      ```shell
         git clone git@github.com:drivebrandstudio/Craft4-Scaffolding.git ./
      ```
      </p>

   <strong>OR</strong>
   <p>
      
      HTTPS:
   
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/drivebrandstudio/Craft4-Scaffolding.git ./
      ```
   </p>
   </details>
   
   <details>
      <summary>
         Templated github repo 
      </summary>
      <p>
         Create a github repo using the template and  clone that to your pc
      </p>
   </details>


1. Add .env file
3. Update package.json, make this project truly your own

    - Project name — must adhere to the [rules of npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#name)
    - author
    - description
1. Setup craft /config/ files
    ```shell
      ddev exec php craft setup
    ```
1. Allow DDEV and makefile to configure the project
   ```shell
   make dev
   ```
   *If successful, your terminal should be taken over by the vite server. Split your terminal window, or open a new terminal to continue. Must leave Vite server running to view the local dev site*
   <details>
      <summary>Problem?</summary>
       This may take a few minutes. Let the terminal run.

   If nothing is happening after 5 minutes (which feels like a very long time...), try running

   ```shell
   ddev poweroff
   ```
   and re-running
      ```shell
   make dev
   ```
   </details>
  

5. Allow DDEV to open the browser, so split your vscode terminal
   ```shell
   ddev launch
   ```

6. **Navigate to <https://{the-project-name}.ddev.site/admin>**

   If you land on a page with server errors or an if(!hasCraftInstalled) then you are on the right track. Now check your .htaccess file and .env (make sure you have your database hooked into ddev correctly)

## FAQ/Tips
### Errors during install
1. Follow the DDEV instructions slowly and carefully. Read each line all the way through, it's faster than skimming and hitting an error and having to debug...
2. Uninstall Ubuntu (all programs related to Ubuntu: Ubuntu, 'install REALEASE (Ubuntu)', .... )
### Prettier
1. You will need to restart the vscode window from the Command Palette (ctrl+shift+p) 
```shell 
Developer: reload window
```
After the reload, let vscode finish loading and indexing, then attempt to use Prettier
